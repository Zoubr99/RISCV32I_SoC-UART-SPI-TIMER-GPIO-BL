# RISCV32I_SoC-UART-SPI-TIMER-GPIO-BL
a repositery for the RISC32I processor design along with a few extra IPs such as the SPI, UART, TIMER, GPIOs and the BL
For Visual Illustration of the Full System Design please refer back to the Readme Notes in repo RISC32I-SoC : https://github.com/Zoubr99/RISCV32I-SoC
